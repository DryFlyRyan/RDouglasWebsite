							I was born and raised in a small town just south of Portland, Oregon.
 						</p>
						<p>
							I have a brother, David (44), and a sister, Kassidy (23). We were all pretty far
							apart in age, so we basically grew up as only children. We have a lot of family in Portland though,
							so we spent a lot of time around our cousins.
 						</p>
						<p>
							I was always in charge of naming the many pets we had growing up.
							Until I was about ten, almost all of them were named "Skippy".

							When I was 18, I moved to Montana to go to college at the University of Montana
							and graduated with a BA in Cultural Anthropolgy.
 						</p>
						<p>
							After graduation, I decided to stay in the state until I was just shy of 30.
							During that time, I spent a lot of time outdoors fishing, hiking, camping, and hunting.

						</p>
						<p>
							I also managed a photography store with a good friend of mine, started (and ended)
							a small local foods periodical, worked for a local TV station, and became board president
							of a popular arts nonprofit.

							I moved out to Colorado, just north of Boulder, to work at a Google Funded
							AdTech startup in February, 2013. The business ended up laying off its entire sales force between September
							and November of 2013.
 						</p>
						<p>
							From there I decided to start my own business, a virtual digital agency, and
							have run that ever since with a small hiatus in 2014 when I worked for a startup
							small business lender and moved to Denver.
						</p>
						<p>
							That break caused my business to pivot from having a dozen-ish contractors and
							working with midsized businesses doing full-spectrum marketing to being primarily
							a solo content writing and some low-level front-end web development.

							In an odd coincidence, we've figured out that his father was a Rhodesian Ridgeback
							 owned by a former client of mine who lives in the same area as where I adopted Ringo. His mother was a Yellow Lab.

								About two years ago I picked up some old carboys on craigslist
								and started brewing beer.
							</p>
							<p>
								After starting with extracts and kits, I've slowly begun the conversion
								to a full-grain setup. The difference here is the ability to have more control
								over the flavor and other characteristics of the beer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even with a new setup though, we're still pretty amateur.
